# Mobile ML Guide

## Description

Mobile ML Guide is an Android application designed to provide users with an interactive introduction to machine learning models. This app includes three widely used machine learning models: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Fully Connected Neural Network. Users can experiment with these models to solve binary classification tasks by customizing their parameters and testing them on different datasets. 

### Key Features
- Selection of machine learning models: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Neural Network.
- Adjustable parameters for each model:
  - **Logistic Regression:** Learning rate.
  - **Decision Tree:** Maximum depth, maximum elements, and leaf size.
  - **Neural Network:** Layer structure, activation functions, learning rate, and epochs.
- Dataset selection: Load predefined datasets or upload custom datasets.
- Metrics display: Accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and others for model evaluation.
- Visualizations: Data distribution and prediction boundaries using AnyChart.

## Technologies Used

- **Kotlin**: Main programming language for Android development.
- **Smile**: Framework for implementing machine learning models.
- **AnyChart**: Library for visualizing data and results.
- **Navigation View**: For intuitive navigation between app fragments.

## Future Plans

- Add more machine learning models such as Random Forest, SVM, and K-Means.
- Enhance the UI/UX for better interactivity.
- Allow export of trained models and results.
- Support for additional data formats.
